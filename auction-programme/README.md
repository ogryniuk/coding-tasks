 The programme creates a map of bidders and winning prices for each round.
 It compares the amounts of bids with the previous winning price and acts based on the following rules:
 1. If the new bid is higher, the new price becomes the previous highest bid of the opponents, plus the starting price.
 2. If the new bid lower, the winning price stays the same
 3. If the new bid is higher, but done by the same player, the winning price also stays the same
